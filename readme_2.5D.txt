The Final Product takes a user generated image,
uploaded or shot with a designated cursor,
and allows a section whereby the user may edit
the suggested edges and make appropriate contours to
his image, create depth in these contours, and finally
complete a contour map of the image which will be used
in the customized process to account for distances of
moved objects.

My project requires opencv 2.4.6 and numpy 1.7.1 for windows
to be installed, as well as python 2.7.5.

It also includes a short music piece and generic backdrop,
